# Making Crossy Road For My Kids

I wanted to start the #100daysofcode challenge by learning Unity. My twin boys' favorite game is Crossy Road. They love the style, the animations, and the gameplay. I wanted to learn Unity and make them their own version of Crossy Road with them as playable characters. 

## Important Information

I do not own this game or it's name in any way. I simply made a game for my kids to play based on characters I created for them.
